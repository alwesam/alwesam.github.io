  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Updated January 30, 2018)</p>

<p>One of the features of the application I have been working on is to
automatically transfer funds via EFT between users.  The payment process of
initiating debit/credit transactions involves uploading a file of transactions
through batch payment API to the payment gateway.  Each line in the file
constitute a transaction.</p>

<p>Since there is a cap on the total dollar amount in each file upload, multiple
batches are to be uploaded.  The issue we have to face is that the payment
gateway server cannot handle multiple API requests in rapid succession. Assuming
a batch limit of $50,000 and a total amount of $20 million that needs to be
processed, that is about 400 batches or API requests!</p>

<h3>Enter Background Job</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good practice to processes API requests (especially those that involve
payments) through separate background jobs.  The advantages are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intensive I/O tasks such as uploading files will be handled separately
in a worker process.</li>
<li>Multiple jobs can be run on separate threads concurrently.  While Ruby doesn&rsquo;t
support CPU multithreading (due to GIL), I/O tasks (such as processing
API requests or writing to disk) can be processed simultaneously.</li>
<li>Background jobs can be retried several times until they are successfully
completed.  The downside part is that we have to ensure that each job is
idempotent (explained later in the post).</li>
</ul>


<p>When batches are created, each is put through a background job in
order to complete an API request. Each job takes in an array of transactions
and creates a file on the fly (which is written to a tmp/ directory); the file
is immediately uploaded through the API request.</p>

<h4>A background job is its own world</h4>

<p>Each job constitutes its own thread with its own data and arguments such that it
can be retried without having to relay on new information.  In the above
example, the main data is an array of transaction objects that include amount,
customer code, and whether it&rsquo;s debit or credit.</p>

<p>Yet, all job threads access the same I/O. More likely than not, unless the
jobs' execution is throttled, subsequent jobs will fail to complete as the API
server is busy.  Suppose that we want to throttle the API requests at 1
request/minute; that means 200 minutes is required to upload all batches.  We
might do better if we do not manually throttle the API requests and instead use
the retrial feature to our advantage where let jobs fail and retried at a rate
determined by the background job processor (see below).</p>

<p>Furthermore, each job is accessing the tmp/ directory to write/upload the batch
file. To prevent cross-contamination/overwriting, files are uniquely named
along with a datetime stamp.</p>

<p>  <em>Writing to tmp/ is very quick. Writing 400 batch files of 25 lines each in
rapid loop takes less than 170ms. Writing a single file much less than 1ms.
It&rsquo;s during the upload that the file risks being overwritten or contaminated if
it&rsquo;s not uniquely identified with a unique identifier</em>.</p>

<p>Another option is to have the batch files created before and sending the files'
paths as data to the background jobs. The main advantage of this approach is
to minimize the risk of cross-contamination of multiple job threads while
accessing the tmp/ directory as well as not having to regenerate the file every
time the job fails. The disadvantage, however, is that the job doesn&rsquo;t include
the transactions data and it has to relay on the tmp directory keeping the file
saved while retrying the job several times after failure.</p>

<h4>Error Handling, Job Completion, and Retries</h4>

<p>To ensure completion, Sidekiq retries failed job up to 25 times after which a
job is moved to dead jobs queue. An error can be raised by a bug in the code or in the
example mentioned above an API error. Also, an exception can be raised if the
job is not complete (batch ID is not returned) forcing a retrial.</p>

</span><span class='line'>     end
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Idempotency</h4>

<p>Idempotency means that a job can be executed multiple safely.  This is
especially important when it comes to financial transactions. There should not
be &ldquo;half-completed&rdquo; transactions.  Any database transaction during the job is to
be rolled back in case of job failure.</p>

<h3>Sidekiq</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq">Sidekiq</a> is employed to manage multiple
HTTP file uploads in the background.  It&rsquo;s noted for speed in comparison to
Delayed Job (4,500 jobs/second and a latency of 10ms). Sidekiq uses Redis for
storing and queuing jobs as opposed to using the database.
Furthermore, Sidekiq has an error-handling mechanism where it retries a failed
job with an exponential backoff.</p>

<h4>Retries</h4>

<p>By default, Sidekiq retries a job after it fails up to 25 times.  The timing of
the retry is governed by this formula:</p>

<p><em>(retry_count**4) + 15 + (rand(30) * (retry_count + 1))</em></p>

<h4>Results</h4>

<p>The code was tested by launching a task to process transactions worth
$8M.  The transactions were distributed in 160 batches ($50K per batch) and each
batch was processed through a separate Sidekiq background thread.</p>

<p>It took about 25 minutes to finish uploading all the files to the payment
gateway.  Of the 160 background jobs, 53 jobs were successfully completed from
the first attempt (i.e. no retrials were needed).  One job took 6 retries before
it was successfully completed.  The average number of retrials was 2.31.</p>

#notes
![](../images/retries.png)
##Time interval at which jobs successfully completed
If the Sidekiq process segfaults or crashes the Ruby VM, any jobs that were
being processed are lost. Sidekiq Pro offers a reliable queueing feature which
does not lose those jobs.
#####To-do list:
* Default of 25 threads per process (concurrency in ruby is not exactly
supported)
* Sidekiq is designed for parallel execution so design your jobs so you can run
lots of them in parallel. It has basic features for tuning concurrency (e.g.
targeting a sidekiq process at a queue with a defined number of threads) but
your system architecture is much simpler if you don't have such specialization.
Set at 20 in production and 5 in development
* Automatic job retry at (retry_count ** 4)+15+(rand(30)*(retry_count+1)).  For
example, at the 6th retry will occur between 640 and 820 seconds after the 5th
retry.
* Custom middleware needed to fetch #job_id and retry_count.
* Also need to customize retry time depending on job so to make them apart based
on job id
* Limit number of pool connections for batch API upload job (go down from
default of 25 to 5 or even to 1) -->
